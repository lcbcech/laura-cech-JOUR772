This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Loading/reading a file
ex:
umd_courses <- read_rds("umd_courses.rds")

Inside of the read_rds() function, we’ve put the name of the file we want to load. Things we put inside of function, to customize what the function does, are called arguments.

---

If we run glimpse(umd_courses), it will give us a list of the columns, the data type for each column and and the first few values for each column.

If we type head(umd_courses), it will print out the columns and the first six rows of data.

----

|> means “and then do this.” This is called the “pipe operator” 
Another way of writing it is: %>%


----

count_classes = n(), says create a new field, called count_classes and set it equal to n()

---

== for equal to, != for not equal to, > for greater than, >= for greater than or equal to and so on.

--
AND is `&` and OR is `|`

--
change char to number
ex:
maryland_expenses <- maryland_expenses |> mutate(expenditure_date=mdy(expenditure_date))

head(maryland_expenses)


---
use summary() and colnames() to get a sense of the data and the data types of each field/variable/column. 
ex:
summary(umd_courses)
colnames(umd_courses)





```{r}
