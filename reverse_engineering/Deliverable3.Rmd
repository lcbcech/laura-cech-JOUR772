## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, In the AP story "Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go?" https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

library(tidyverse)
library(refinr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

```

Load data

```{r}
population <- read_csv("data/population-by-age.csv")
private <- read_csv("data/private-enrollment-by-grade.csv")
public <- read_csv("data/public-enrollment-by-grade.csv")
missing <- read_excel("data/Missing-Kids-Summary-File.xlsx")
```

### Sentence 2 

* **Sentence text**: Some of those students enrolled in private schools. Across the states in the analysis, private-school enrollment grew by about 103,000 students.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] 
We filtered by the 21 states used in their analysis, and then found the sum of students enrolled in the school years "2021-22" and "2019-2020" and subtracted the difference. Our answer, 102,847 of students, is the same number, if we rounded to 103,000 students enrolled.

```{r}
glimpse(private)
```

```{r}
private_all21 <- private |>
filter(state =="CA"| state=="NY" | state=="LA" | state=="NC"| state=="WA"| state=="CO" | state=="GA" | state=="MN" | state=="WI" | state=="NH" | state=="MA" | state=="MT" | state=="DE"| state=="ND" | state=="DC" | state=="SD" | state=="SC" | state=="NE" | state=="RI" | state=="TN" | state=="PA" | state=="FL") |>
  group_by(sch_year) |>
  filter(grade=="k_12_total") |>
  summarise(total=sum(enrollment))

glimpse(private_all21)
```
```{r}
private_2021_2022 <-private_all21 |> 
filter(sch_year == "2021-2022")

###
private_2019_2020 <- private_all21 |> 
filter(sch_year == "2019-2020")

###

private_2021_2022$total - private_2019_2020$total
```

### Sentence 3 

* **Sentence text**: A much bigger group of students switched to home-schooling. The number of children registered for home-schooling surged by around 184,000.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] Yes, we got 184,047. I converted character values in the total change column into numerical values. (Alisha did it slightly differently)]
