## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, In the AP story "Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go?" https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Load data

```{r}
population <- read_csv("data/population-by-age.csv")

public <- read_csv("data/public-enrollment-by-grade.csv")
missing <- read_excel("data/Missing-Kids-Summary-File.xlsx")

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: Overall, public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years in the 21 states plus Washington, D.C., that provided the necessary data.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] Once we figured out that we needed to filter by the 21 states that were listed in the spreadsheet, we created (with help) a filtered dataset. From there, we could summarize the k-12 total by year and confirm the difference in enrollment as 704,593

```{r}


```


```{r}
public_21 <- public |>
filter(st =="CA"| st=="NY" | st=="LA" | st=="NC"| st=="WA"| st=="CO" | st=="GA" | st=="MN" | st=="WI" | st=="NH" | st=="MA" | st=="MT" | st=="DE"| st=="ND" | st=="DC" | st=="SD" | st=="SC" | st=="NE" | st=="RI" | st=="TN" | st=="PA" | st=="FL") |>
  group_by(sch_year) |>
  filter(grade=="k_12_total") |>
  summarise(total=sum(enrollment))
 

  
```


```{r}


public_2019 <- public_21 |>
  filter(sch_year == "2019-2020")
public_2019_enrollment <- public_2019$total
public_2019_enrollment

###

public_2021 <- public_21 |>
  filter(sch_year =="2021-2022")
public_2021_enrollment <-public_2021$total
public_2021_enrollment

public_2021_enrollment - public_2019_enrollment



```

```{r}
#total 2021-22
public|>
  filter(sch_year == "2021-2022") |>
   filter(grade == "k_12_total") |>
   summarise(total = sum(enrollment, na.rm = TRUE))



```

```{r}
49202913	- 47997006	
```


```{r}
public |>
  filter(state == "ALASKA") 
  
```
