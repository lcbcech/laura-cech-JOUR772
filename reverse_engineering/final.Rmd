## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, In the AP story "Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go?" https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html

#Load data
population <- read_csv("/Users/lauracech/Documents/GitHub/laura-cech-JOUR772/reverse_engineering/data/population-by-age.csv")
private <- read_csv("/Users/lauracech/Documents/GitHub/laura-cech-JOUR772/reverse_engineering/data/private-enrollment-by-grade.csv")

full_state_names <- c("california", "new york", "louisiana", "north carolina", "washington", "colorado", "georgia", "minnesota", "wisconsin", "new hampshire", "massachusetts", "montana", "delaware", "north dakota", "district of columbia", "south dakota", "south carolina", "nebraska", "rhode island", "tennessee", "pennsylvania", "florida")
```


```{r}
the_21 <- c("CA", "NY", "LA", "NC", "WA", "CO","GA", "MN", "WI", "NH", "MA", "MT", "DE", "ND", "DC", "SD", "SC", "NE", "RI", "TN", "PA", "FL") 
```

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: Overall, public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years in the 21 states plus Washington, D.C., that provided the necessary data.

* **Analysis summary**: Once we figured out that we needed to filter by the 21 states that were listed in the spreadsheet, we created (with help) a filtered dataset. From there, we could summarize the k-12 total by year and confirm the difference in enrollment as 704,593.

```{r}
glimpse(public)

public_21 <- public |>
  filter(st %in% the_21) |>
  group_by(sch_year) |>
  filter(grade=="k_12_total") |>
  summarise(total=sum(enrollment))

##
public_2021 <- public_21 |>
  filter(sch_year =="2021-2022")
public_2021_enrollment <-public_2021$total
public_2021_enrollment

public_2021_enrollment - public_2019_enrollment


```

### Sentence 2 

* **Sentence text**: Some of those students enrolled in private schools. Across the states in the analysis, private-school enrollment grew by about 103,000 students.

* **Analysis summary**: We filtered by the 21 states used in their analysis, and then found the sum of students enrolled in the school years "2021-22" and "2019-2020" and subtracted the difference. Our answer, 102,847 of students, is the same number, if we rounded to 103,000 students enrolled.

```{r}
glimpse(private)
private_all21 <- private |>
  filter(state %in% the_21) |>
  group_by(sch_year) |>
  filter(grade=="k_12_total") |>
  summarise(total=sum(enrollment))

glimpse(private_all21)

```

```{r}
private_2021_2022 <-private_all21 |> 
filter(sch_year == "2021-2022")

###
private_2019_2020 <- private_all21 |> 
filter(sch_year == "2019-2020")

###

private_2021_2022$total - private_2019_2020$total


```

### Sentence 3 

* **Sentence text**: A much bigger group of students switched to home-schooling. The number of children registered for home-schooling surged by around 184,000.

* **Analysis summary**: We got 184,047. We created (with help) a .csv file from a tab in an excel spreadsheet.

I converted character values in the total change column into numerical values. (Alisha did it slightly differently but with the same result.)

```{r}
#Disclaimer, use of Chat CPT to create a .csv file from a tab in an excel sheet
#Prompt = "how do you create a .csv file from a tab in an excel sheet in Rstudio?"

missing_homeschool <- read_excel("/Users/lauracech/Desktop/Missing-Kids-Summary-File copy.xlsx", sheet = "Enrollment Changes")

write.csv(missing_homeschool, "missing_homeschool.csv", row.names = FALSE)

glimpse(missing_homeschool)

```
```{r}
#Filter 21 states + DC
homeschool_all21 <- missing_homeschool |> 
  mutate(State = str_to_lower(State)) |>
  filter(State %in% full_state_names)

glimpse(homeschool_all21)
```
```{r}
homeschool_all21 <- homeschool_all21 %>%
  mutate(`School Year 2019-20` = readr::parse_number(`School Year 2019-20`),
         `School Year 2020-2021` = readr::parse_number(`School Year 2020-2021`),
         `School Year 2021-22` = readr::parse_number(`School Year 2021-22`))

# Filter and summarize the homeschool enrollment data
homeschool_data <- homeschool_all21 %>%
  filter(`Enrollment type` == "Homeschool enrollment") %>%
  summarize(
    Total_2019_20 = sum(`School Year 2019-20`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total_2021_22 = sum(`School Year 2021-22`, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Calculate the increase in homeschooling from 2019-20 to 2021-22
increase <- homeschool_data$Total_2021_22 - homeschool_data$Total_2019_20

# Print the increase 
print(increase)
```

### Sentence 4 

* **Sentence text**: Some families also moved out of state, accounting for some enrollment decline. And birth rates in some states are falling. The population of school-age kids in the states we studied fell by about 183,000, according to census estimates.

* **Analysis summary**: Yes, we found the poplulation fell 183,486.

We don't need to filter the dataset for the ages 5-17 (school-age kids) because it's already done, but we double-checked.
Filtered out the July 2020 data so we can compare April 2020 to July 2021;
Removed columns we don't need;
Grouped by state, year;
Summarize population;
Pivot data to create a row with each state showing 2020 and 2021 data;
Calculate the population shift from April 2020 to July 2021 by creating a column that shows difference in 2020 to 2021;
Mutate state column to lowercase and filter for the 21 states.


```{r}
pop_shift <- population |>
  filter(est_date != ymd("2020-07-01")) |>
  mutate(year = year(est_date)) |>
  select(-fips, -est_date) |>
  group_by(state, year) |>
  summarise(population = sum(population)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = population) |>
  clean_names() |>
  mutate(difference = x2020-x2021)  |>
  arrange((difference)) |>
  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state))|>
  filter(state %in% full_state_names) |>
  adorn_totals()



```



### Conclusion: That leaves an estimated 230,000 students still unaccounted for in the data. These are children who didnâ€™t sign up for private school or home-school or move out of state. They are missing.

```{r}
#public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students
