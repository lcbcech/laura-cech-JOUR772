## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, In the AP story "Thousands of kids are missing from school. Where did they go?" https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: Overall, public school enrollment fell by over 700,000 students between the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 school years in the 21 states plus Washington, D.C., that provided the necessary data.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] 
Once we figured out that we needed to filter by the 21 states that were listed in the spreadsheet, we created (with help) a filtered dataset. From there, we could summarize the k-12 total by year and confirm the difference in enrollment as 704,593.

```{r}
public_21 <- public |>
filter(st =="CA"| st=="NY" | st=="LA" | st=="NC"| st=="WA"| st=="CO" | st=="GA" | st=="MN" | st=="WI" | st=="NH" | st=="MA" | st=="MT" | st=="DE"| st=="ND" | st=="DC" | st=="SD" | st=="SC" | st=="NE" | st=="RI" | st=="TN" | st=="PA" | st=="FL") |>
  group_by(sch_year) |>
  filter(grade=="k_12_total") |>
  summarise(total=sum(enrollment))
```

```{r}

public_2019 <- public_21 |>
  filter(sch_year == "2019-2020")
public_2019_enrollment <- public_2019$total
public_2019_enrollment

###

public_2021 <- public_21 |>
  filter(sch_year =="2021-2022")
public_2021_enrollment <-public_2021$total
public_2021_enrollment

public_2021_enrollment - public_2019_enrollment

```


### Sentence 2 

 **Sentence text**: Some of those students enrolled in private schools. Across the states in the analysis, private-school enrollment grew by about 103,000 students.

 **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] 
We filtered by the 21 states used in their analysis, and then found the sum of students enrolled in the school years "2021-22" and "2019-2020" and subtracted the difference. Our answer, 102,847 of students, is the same number, if we rounded to 103,000 students enrolled.

```{r}
glimpse(private)
```

```{r}
private_all21 <- private |>
filter(state =="CA"| state=="NY" | state=="LA" | state=="NC"| state=="WA"| state=="CO" | state=="GA" | state=="MN" | state=="WI" | state=="NH" | state=="MA" | state=="MT" | state=="DE"| state=="ND" | state=="DC" | state=="SD" | state=="SC" | state=="NE" | state=="RI" | state=="TN" | state=="PA" | state=="FL")
```

### Sentence 3 

* **Sentence text**: A much bigger group of students switched to home-schooling. The number of children registered for home-schooling surged by around 184,000.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?] 
Yes, we got 184,047. I converted character values in the total change column into numerical values. (Alisha did it slightly differently but with the same result.)

missing_homeschool <- read_excel("/Users/lauracech/Desktop/Missing-Kids-Summary-File copy.xlsx", sheet = "Enrollment Changes")

write.csv(missing_homeschool, "missing_homeschool.csv", row.names = FALSE)

glimpse(missing_homeschool)

#homeschool_all21 <- missing_homeschool |> 
#filter(State =="CA"| State=="NY" | State=="LA" | State=="NC"| State=="WA"| State=="CO" | State=="GA" | State=="MN" | #State=="WI" | State=="NH" | State=="MA" | State=="MT" | State=="DE"| State=="ND" | State=="DC" | State=="SD" | State=="SC" #| State=="NE" | State=="RI" | State=="TN" | State=="PA" | State=="FL")


#glimpse(homeschool_all21)
```
```{r}
homeschool_all21 <- missing_homeschool |> 
filter(`State abbrev` =="CA"| `State abbrev` =="NY" | `State abbrev`=="LA" | `State abbrev`=="NC"| `State abbrev`=="WA"| `State abbrev`=="CO" | `State abbrev`=="GA" | `State abbrev`=="MN" | `State abbrev`=="WI" | `State abbrev`=="NH" | `State abbrev`=="MA" | `State abbrev`=="MT" | `State abbrev`=="DE"| `State abbrev`=="ND" | `State abbrev`=="DC" | `State abbrev`=="SD" | `State abbrev`=="SC" | `State abbrev`=="NE" | `State abbrev`=="RI" | `State abbrev`=="TN" | `State abbrev`=="PA" | `State abbrev`=="FL") |> 
filter(`Enrollment type` == "Homeschool enrollment" ) 
```

```{r}
homeschool_all21 <- homeschool_all21 %>%
  mutate(
    num_change = as.numeric(`Total change`)) |>
  summarise(sum_change = sum(num_change, na.rm = TRUE))



```


```{r}
print(homeschool_all21)
```

* **Sentence 4 text**: Some families also moved out of state, accounting for some enrollment decline. And birth rates in some states are falling. The population of school-age kids in the states we studied fell by about 183,000, according to census estimates.

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

Here are the steps: 
Filter for the 21 states.
I don't think I need to filter the dataset for the ages 5-17 (school-age kids) because it looks like that's already done.
Calculate the population shift from April 2020 to July 2021 for each state.
Sum the population shifts to get the total shift for the 21 states.

****Sentence #5: That leaves an estimated 230,000 students still unaccounted for in the data. These are children who didnâ€™t sign up for private school or home-school or move out of state. They are missing.
